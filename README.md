# Raw-Project-Aukat-Logic-c-
The basic c# app of the project aukat
In this we have two versions of the app the dektop as well as the dektop to demonstarte the universal capabilities of the windows app design.
Also the most important thing to be taken from this code is parser for json as well the model.
this app uses the popular MVVM approach but ViewModel is not explitly implemented rather is triggered in the same function that is triggered by the click of button.
